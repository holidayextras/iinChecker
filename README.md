#### EditorConfig

EditorConfig helps us define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.  If you are using Sublime Editor you can install the `EditorConfig` using [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net).

For non Sublime development a bunch of other IDE plugins are available [here](http://editorconfig.org/#download)

## Documentation

## Notes on coding style

Code is linted by ".jshintrc" and checked against the coding style guide "shortbreaks.jscs.json" when you run the default grunt task:
```
$ grunt
```

## Tests

Tests will run using the default grunt task but can also be called stand-alone using:
